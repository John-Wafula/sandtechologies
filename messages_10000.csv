Here's how peer grading works:
1. After submitting your milestone before the deadline, you will be assigned a peer to grade your work.
2. To find out if a peer has been assigned to you, you can click on the specific milestone you submitted.
3. On Kritik, you can see if you have been assigned a peer to grade your work.
4. Once you have completed your assigned peer evaluation, you will see a checkmark next to the assigned peer's name on Canvas.
5. The ALX team reviews all grades during the transition week.

If you feel that your peer has graded you incorrectly, you can dispute the grade on Kritik. However, please note that you cannot change grades on Kritik yourself. The ALX team will review all disputed grades and non-graded milestones.

Unfortunately, formal deferments are not possible at this time for individual delays due to capacity constraints. If you are unable to participate currently, your options are to either withdraw or explore potential special arrangements. 

If you choose to withdraw, please be aware of the following:
- The withdrawal action is irreversible, and all your account details and progress will be deleted.
- Access to program platforms and communities, including Slack and peer circles, will be lost.
- You can initiate the withdrawal process by clicking ""Get Support"" in your student portal and selecting the withdraw option.

After withdrawal, you would need to reapply for a future cohort when applications reopen, typically in 4-6 months as per the program website updates.

I apologize for the inconvenience you're experiencing with accessing the ALX AiCE program and the Intranet. I understand the frustration this may cause. 

Based on the information available in the knowledge base, it seems that there have been challenges with accessing the learning portal due to a high number of learners being onboarded. However, clearing your browsing history and cache should usually resolve this issue.

Since you have already followed the troubleshooting steps and are still unable to access the program, I recommend reaching out to the support team directly. They will be better equipped to assist you in resolving this matter promptly. You can provide them with the screenshot you attached to help them understand the problem you're facing.

When encountering issues with the checker, it's crucial to follow specific troubleshooting steps to address the problem effectively. Here are some key points to consider based on the information provided in our knowledge base:

1. **Troubleshooting Steps for Checker Issues**:
   - Clear your browser history and cache to ensure optimal performance.
   - Log out of the intranet, then log back in and attempt the checker again.
   - Verify that all project requirements are met, especially regarding the availability of sandboxes or web terminals during the checker evaluation.
   - If the checker interface remains unresponsive or displays technical issues, contact our IT mentors on Slack for further assistance by using the @mentor tag in your cohort's channel.

2. **Checker Scoring 0%**:
   - If the checker scores zero on your project, it could be due to various reasons.
   - Ensure that your sandbox or web terminal remains available until the auto-review is completed.
   - If the issue persists, reach out to a technical mentor on Discord using your cohort-specific channel and mention @mentor for prompt assistance.

3. Try a different browser: If you're using a specific browser, try accessing the program using a different one. Sometimes, browser compatibility issues can prevent login.

3. Program-related Communications: If you are already enrolled in an ALX program, you may be receiving program-related communications. These messages could include updates, reminders, or important information about your program.

Withdrawing from the program means you are not interested in continuing with the program and are quitting ALX. Once you withdraw, your account will be deleted, and you will lose access to all ALX platforms and learning portals. 

To officially withdraw, you can log into your student portal and click the ""Get Support"" button. From there, you can select the option to withdraw, and the progress deletion process will begin. Please keep in mind that withdrawals are permanent and irreversible. If you decide to rejoin ALX later, you will need to fully reapply.

If you are still interested in the program after withdrawing, you must apply again via www.alxafrica.com. Unfortunately, there are no alternatives to withdrawing from the ALX Program. Changing specialization tracks or program switches are not possible. However, we encourage you to consider applying for alternative programs if you wish to continue your learning journey with us.

1. Refresh your browser: Sometimes, a simple refresh can resolve temporary issues. Press the refresh button on your browser or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + R (Windows) or Command + R (Mac) to refresh the page.

2. Clear your browser cache and cookies: Clearing your cache and cookies can help resolve any stored data conflicts. You can find instructions on how to clear your cache and cookies for different browsers [here](https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/).

3. Update your browser: Ensure that you are using the latest version of your browser. Outdated versions may not be compatible with Canvas. You can check for updates and follow the browser's instructions for updating.

4. Try using a different browser: If the issue persists, try accessing Canvas using a different browser. Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox are commonly recommended browsers for Canvas.

5. Use an incognito or private browsing window: Open an incognito or private browsing window and try accessing Canvas. This can help identify if any browser extensions or settings are causing the issue.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, I recommend reaching out to the ALX Support Team for further assistance. You can contact them [here](https://alxprograms.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new). They will be able to provide you with more specific guidance based on your situation.

For instance, in the ALX Foundations program, failing to submit milestones or scoring below the required average across quizzes could impact one's progress and eligibility for graduation. Late submissions might also incur penalties such as a deduction in grading.

In the case of the AiCE program, missing milestones or failing to meet submission deadlines may lead to milestones being labeled as ""Late"" and graded out of 90% instead of 100%. It is crucial to note that the passing score remains at 75%, emphasizing the importance of timely and quality submissions to maintain progress in the program.

If a learner faces challenges or failures within a month, it is advisable to communicate with the program team for guidance on next steps, possible catch-up opportunities, or any remedial actions available. Consistent communication and effort are key to addressing setbacks and ensuring a successful learning journey within the ALX programs.",1,0,0,2024-05-27 22:13:35,12,204

MvbmwqR2AeYA,joQeZnpB2epZ,"If your milestone score is below 75% and you believe it should have been graded differently, our ALX graders will review it to ensure accuracy. They will reevaluate your milestone to make sure it was graded correctly. Please be patient as this process may take some time, but rest assured that your score will be updated once the review is completed. If you have any concerns or questions during this period, feel free to reach out to us for further assistance.",1,0,0,2024-03-16 18:08:54,4,93
